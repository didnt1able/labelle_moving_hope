## When To Start Packing For A Move (Week-By-Week Guide)


::: tip Remember
Packing your home for a move is a significant task that requires careful planning. With years of experience in the moving industry, I can attest that preparation is key to a smooth moving process. Here’s a comprehensive week-by-week guide to help you get started.
:::

## 6-8 Weeks Before Your Move: Clean and Organize

- [ ] **Clean Your Home**: Begin with a thorough cleaning. This will make it easier to decide what to take with you.
- [ ] **Declutter**: Go through each room and decide which items you no longer need. Fewer items mean a cheaper and more organized move.
- [ ] **Separate Unwanted Items**: Collect unwanted items together to get an idea of how much you’ll be moving and receive an accurate moving estimate.

### 5 Weeks Before Your Move: Sell or Donate Unwanted Items

- [ ] **Garage Sale**: Sell items you no longer need to save on moving costs and earn extra cash.
- [ ] **Donate**: Donate items that are not worth selling. Ask for a receipt for tax purposes.
- [ ] **Dispose of Furniture**: Refer to our guide on getting rid of old furniture.
- [ ] **Plan for Non-Allowables**: Check the list of items movers won’t transport and plan accordingly.

### 4 Weeks Before Your Move: Finalize Details with Your Moving Company

- [ ] **Confirm Details**: Ensure you have a confirmed moving date with your moving company.
- [ ] **Review Moving Plan**: Go over the plan with your moving company to ensure everything is clear.

### 2-3 Weeks Before Your Move: Begin Packing

- [ ] **Gather Packing Materials**: Purchase supplies from Home Depot or online, and use household items like linens and towels.
- [ ] **Pack Non-Essentials First**: Start with storage rooms, closets, and the garage.
- [ ] **Pack by Room**: Keep boxes in their respective rooms for easy organization.
- [ ] **Label Boxes**: Clearly mark each box with its contents and designated room.
- [ ] **Stage Items in the Garage**: Use garage space for packed non-essential items.
- [ ] **Personal Items**: Move valuable and personal items yourself to ensure their safety.

### 3 Most Crucial Packing Tips

- [ ] **Valuable Items**: Keep jewelry, cash, and important documents with you.
- [ ] **Day Box**: Pack a box with daily essentials like medications, toiletries, and clothes.
- [ ] **Time Management**: Start early to avoid last-minute stress.

### 1 Week Before Your Move: Final Preparations

- [ ] **Kitchen Packing**: Organize and use proper materials to protect fragile items.
- [ ] **Clothes and Bedding**: Dressers can be moved with clothes inside if not overpacked.
- [ ] **Final Checks**: Ensure all boxes are labeled and packed securely.

### Related Questions:

**Packing Strategy**: Decide what to move first and pack non-essential items room by room. Use appropriate materials for fragile items.

**Self-Packing vs. Hiring Movers**: Full-service movers can pack for you but at a higher cost. Packing yourself saves money, but movers won’t be liable for box contents.
